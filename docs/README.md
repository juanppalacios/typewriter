# Objective
This project is intended to improve the typing workflow for reports, documentation, and text-heavy use-cases.

# Workflow
The main idea is to allow a user to type a document in markdown and receive a formatted pdf file. A simple script will parse a markdown file, look for special commands and regular text, and translate it into a Latex file. This tool requires the use of a Latex compiler (Latex Workshop + MacTex).
